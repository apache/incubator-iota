#Sample Orchestrations

This directory contains a number of samples of Fey orchestrations. Note
if you move one or more of these to the active-json-repo the Fey engine will
start to run the execution. You need to make sure that all the necessary jar files
used by the orchestrations are available in the active-jar-repo. If the needed
jar file is not available the orchestration will fail to execute.
